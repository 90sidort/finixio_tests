# Dependecies needed to run the project
- Chrome 96.0.4664.45 [Download](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/)
- Chromedriver 96.0.4664.45 [Download](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=96.0.4664.45/) - remember to add it to $PATH [Manual](https://zwbetz.com/download-chromedriver-binary-and-add-to-your-path-for-automated-functional-testing/)
- JDK 11 [Download](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-4A6BD592-1840-4BB4-A758-4CD49E9EE88B)

I'd also recommend use of [IntelliJ 2021.3](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux) with UTF-8 encoding.
